LOOPY
a tool for thinking in systems

WHY: one/two sentences about systems thinking for a complex world,
feedback loops or whatever

THREE GIFS:
1. interactive simulations to ask "what if"
2. program by DRAWING (drag and drop is too mainstream)
3. remix (a dialogue, not just a monologue. thinking in -> talking in)

mini: use it for...

TRY AN EXAMPLE:
(or, make your own from scratch)

Happy simulating!
