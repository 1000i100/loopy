Version 1.2:
- ADD : simple mode and advanced mode (to keep it simple but really powerful when need)
- ADD : node custom signal behavior ( allways transmit || transmit if outbound || transmit if overflow, die if empty )
- ADD : node signal aggregation latency setting (from none to 6.4s by x2 step)
- ADD : edge sign behavior (classic relationship behavior || convert to arrow sign || filter by arrow sign)
- ADD : edge custom color and gradient

Version 1.1:
- node amounts are now "uncapped"    
- better distribution of "signals"

Version 1.0: the whole everything.
