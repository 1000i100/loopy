Version 2.0 (by [1000i100](https://github.com/1000i100)) : 
- ADD : simple mode and advanced mode (to keep it simple but really powerful when need)
- ADD : node custom signal behavior ( allways transmit || transmit if outbound || transmit if overflow, die if empty )
- ADD : node signal aggregation latency setting (from none to 6.4s by x2 step)
- ADD : edge sign behavior (classic relationship behavior || convert to arrow sign || filter by arrow sign)
- ADD : edge custom color and gradient

Version 1.1 (by [Nicky Case](https://github.com/ncase)) :
- node amounts are now "uncapped"    
- better distribution of "signals"

Version 1.0 (by [Nicky Case](https://github.com/ncase)) :
- the whole everything.
