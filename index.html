<h3 style="margin-top:0; text-align:center">a tool to model feedback loops [WIP]</h3>

<p>
Most of us think cause &amp; effect is <i>linear</i>: A causes B, B causes C, and so on.
But the most pressing problems of our day are not linear, they're <i>loopy</i>:
A affects B, but B also affects A!
That <i>loopiness</i> is what makes these problems so hard for us to understand,
and thus, so hard for us to solve.
</p>

<p>
<b>LOOPY</b> is a tool I'm creating, to make it easy to see, play with, and model <i>feedback loops</i>.
I'm still figuring out how to make the user interface intuitive and such, which is why I need your help!
Please play with the 3 examples below, and let me know if... uh, any of this makes sense. Thanks!
</p>

<p>
<b>ECOLOGY:</b> 
Loop #1: Elk reduce the number of plants by eating them,
but plants increase the number of elk by feeding them.
Loop #2: Wolves reduce the number of elk by eating them,
but elk increase the number of wolves by feeding them.
</p>

<p>
The result is the ecological cycles below!
</p>

<p class="caption">
<b>
hover over each circle to see its controls.
<br>
click <i>&amp; hold</i> to make a thing increase or decrease:
</b>
</p>

<iframe src="play/2-ecosystem.html" width="560" height="240" scrolling="no"></iframe>

<p>
These loops result in some pretty counter-intuitive results!
For example, in Yellowstone Park, the ecosystem had a significantly lower
number of plants and animals. But by re-introducing <i>wolves</i>,
it helped the ecosystem (partially) grow back! How?
Because wolves ate the elk, who were eating up all the plants,
thus not leaving enough vegetation for <i>other</i> small herbivores to live.
(see this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysa5OBhXz-Q">How Wolves Changed Rivers</a>)
</p>
<p>
<b>You can also see this in action, by chaning the number of wolves in the above simulation.</b>
What happens when wolves are <i>taken out</i> of the ecosystem?
What happens when wolves are <i>re-introduced</i> into the ecosystem?
</p>

<b>ECONOMICS:</b> 
It's no secret that college tuition is ridonkulously high right now.
And this doesn't just impact economics – <i>the</i> biggest social &amp; political divide right now
is between people with a four-year college degree, and those without.
</p>
<p>
Here's the main feedback loop:
the higher the demand for college, the higher tuition will be.
But the more expensive college is, the fewer students will be able to go to college.
Here's what that looks like, below:
(I added another loop from students to themselves, to simulate overcrowding, and also
to "dampen" the cycle so it settles into an "equilibrium")
</p>

<p class="caption">
<b>
let's say you want to increase the number of students who go to college.
what happens if you <i>directly</i> increase students?
</b>
</p>

<iframe src="play/3-college.html" width="260" height="360" scrolling="no"></iframe>

<p>
And <i>that's</i> one problem with student loan programs right now.
They artificially increase the number of students going to college,
thus driving the college price even further up,
<i>thus making students even more dependent on loan programs</i>.
And of course, this hurts students way later on, as they spend decades
trying to pay off that massive debt. (you can't even wipe that debt clean
with bankruptcy!?)
</p>

<p>
However, the nice thing about LOOPY's simulations is that you can try out <i>alternative</i>
solutions, right in the model itself!
<b>Can you find a way to increase students <i>and</i> decrease tuition?</b>
</p>

<b>MENTAL HEALTH:</b> 
Loop #1: high energy causes manic thoughts, manic thoughts causes high energy.
Loop #2: low energy causes depression, depression causes low energy.
</p>
<p>
Previously, we saw feedback loops that go to or cycle around a single "equilibrium",
but now, this system has TWO "equilibria"!
They're both stable, but only semi-stable, since a large boost or drop in energy can
cause the whole mind to flip between those two states:
</p>

<p class="caption">
<b>
increase &amp; decrease energy to make the mind flip between mania and depression.
(note that a SHORT boost/drop in energy won't be enough to hit the "tipping point")
</b>
</p>

<p>
This model is based off <a href="https://twitter.com/MicheleNuijten/status/801066550862065664">this brilliant paper</a>,
which proposes that depression &amp; anxiety may not have any "underlying root cause", (linear cause-and-effect)
but rather, these mental disorders are <i>feedback loops between its various symptoms</i>. (loopy cause-and-effect!)
</p>

<p>
There are many problems with the "single root cause" linear model:
1) depression &amp; anxiety can have completely different symptoms in different people
2) depression &amp; anxiety can have completely different <i>causes/triggers</i> for different people
3) once you stop taking medications, the depression &amp; anxiety can come back.
</p>

<p>
This "loopy" model solves all those problems.
It's a new idea that still needs a lot more data to prove or disprove it,
but still, it's elegant and promising.

<b>Thanks for playing! What do you think so far?</b>
For this prototype, I'm mostly need to know:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
	<b>Does the visualization make sense?</b>
	The growing &amp; shrinking bubbles, the circles connected with arrows, the "+" and "-" on the arrows, etc
</li>
<li>
	<b>Do the controls make sense?</b>
	Hovering over the circle to see their controls, then click and/or holding the arrows to make 'em grow/shrink.
</li>
<li>
	<b>Overall thoughts?</b>
	How does it all <i>feel?</i> Do the simulations actually add insight to the topics of
	ecology / economics / mental health?
	What did you like or not like?
	What was confusing or insightful?
	What other features do you want?
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Thank you in advance!
